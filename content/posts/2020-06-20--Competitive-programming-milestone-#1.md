# Introduction

I was introduced to competitive programming by one of my professors at John Abbott College back in April of this year and have been enjoying solving these types of problems so far. I enjoy the instant feedback you get when you finally understand a concept and can apply it to a problem right away. This feedback is also useful in keeping track of progress and keeping motivated during times you feel like you're stuck because you can always look back and see how far you've come. I've recently hit top 1,000 users on the Kattis online judge platform and so, here is what I've learned so far solving my first few hundred problems and participating in a few contests.

# The importance (or not?) of a specific programming language

I feel like when starting out with competitive programming, most people want to know what language is the 'best' for it. While each language has it's own unique set of pros and cons, what's most important is choosing one and sticking with it. I've been using Python mainly when implementing solutions due to it's easy syntax and it's decent standard library. By sticking with Python these past few months I've been A) able to become really good at a language I've barely touched before and B) implemented common techniques seen in problems in this language, all the while enhancing my problem solving abilities. 

Many factors go into if you can efficiently solve a problem or not, and by sticking to one language the syntax no longer becomes a barrier towards solving a problem.

While the community tends to flock toward C++, I believe sticking with one that is most comfortable to you will help you understand concepts much faster.

# Time complexity

Pretty important to know, I feel like I can estimate time complexity pretty accurately now as I evaluate my programs constantly and think of ways to make my programs more efficient.

# Searching & Sorting

Many problems I've done involved either searching or sorting as a subproblem in order to generate the solution. 

While mainly utilizing Python's built in sorting methods and linear scanning stuff, I've learned binary search and implemented insertion sort and bubble sort for a problem. For the most part, any languages standard libraries sort function will do for most problems, implementing merge sort or quick sort during a contest is just slow. It's still cool to learn what is going on under the hood however.

Some cool sorting problems I've solved:
- [Mjehuric](https://open.kattis.com/problems/mjehuric) (Bubble sort)
- [Sort of Sorting](https://open.kattis.com/problems/sortofsorting)
- [Sort](https://open.kattis.com/problems/sort) (Counting sort-ish)
- [Height Ordering](https://open.kattis.com/problems/height) (Insertion sort)

# Hash Maps

One of the most fundamental data structures in programming, I've gotten pretty good at solving problems using hash maps or dictionaries in Python. When I get stuck I always think if applying a hash map to the problem will make things easier. They provide an easy way to map a key to a value with efficient methods for searching, inserting and deleting.

Some problems I've solved utilizing hash maps:
- [Problem Classification](https://open.kattis.com/problems/problemclassification)
- [Conformity](https://open.kattis.com/problems/conformity)
- [Metaprogramming](https://open.kattis.com/problems/metaprogramming)
- [Babelfish](https://open.kattis.com/problems/babelfish)
- [Costume Contest](https://open.kattis.com/problems/costumecontest)

# Hash Sets

Similar to Hash Maps, a set only allows for storage of unique keys. This makes it useful when dealing with disposable duplicate values or checking for duplicates. Alongside hash maps, I'd say this is also one of my favourites to use at the moment. 

Some hash set problems I've solved:
- [What does the fox say?](https://open.kattis.com/problems/whatdoesthefoxsay)
- [Boat Parts](https://open.kattis.com/problems/boatparts)
- [Compound Words](https://open.kattis.com/problems/compoundwords)

# Stacks

Another great data structure, this one I've picked up recently and am having fun applying it to different problems. Stacks allow for inserting only to the top and popping from only the top of the stack, which can be utilized in many ways to meet the needs of a given problem.

Some cool stack problems I've recently solved:
- [Pairing Socks](https://open.kattis.com/problems/pairingsocks)
- [The Grand Adventure](https://open.kattis.com/problems/thegrandadventure)
- [Delimiter Soup](https://open.kattis.com/problems/delimitersoup) (Bracket Matching)

# Conclusion

While I still have a long way to go until becoming actually good, It's nice to look back and review what I've learned and to think I didn't know most of this a couple months ago. 

I'm currently participating in bi-weekly contests held by Compete McGill and also struggling through the material taught as well.

Some things I hope to get comfortable with and better at in the near future:
- Queues
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming and Recursion
