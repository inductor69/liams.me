# Introduction
Contributing to open source can seem like a daunting task, but it doesn’t have to be. You see, many people believe that to achieve a ‘good’ open source contribution, it needs to restructure and optimize the entire project. However, this cannot be further from the truth. Here is a very high level overview with my personal story on getting started.

# First steps
The reasons that project owners open source their software is likely to be some of the few:

- To accelerate the development process.

- Have like minded developers work toward developing a solution to a problem that they themselves are having.

- Help developers learn and network by working on unique solutions with each other.

By taking an interest in one of these projects, you are joining a community whose main goal is likely to be altruistic regarding the project at hand. They most likely want to help newcomers learn about the project so that they may potentially add value to it in the future, no matter the size.

Get started by looking over the README and CONTRIBUTING files and feel free to ask any questions about getting started. Once you’re all setup you can go ahead and look over any open issues the project has and try your hand at a few.

Even if you don’t end up making a PR, looking over the code base and trying to fix open issues will lead you into becoming more familiar with the project over time which can help with making future contributions.

# My first pull request
I recently created my first ever pull request on April 14th, 2020 in an open source project.

The PublicLab organization is kind enough to maintain many beginner friendly open source projects for newcomers to contribute to.

I so happened to stumble upon their Leaflet.DistortableImage project, a LeafletJS extension to distort images.

The issue was that one of their methods had not been updated to ES6 syntax. So I went ahead and resolved this issue. Here were the [changes](https://github.com/publiclab/Leaflet.DistortableImage/pull/606).

Not a whole lot going on here as you can see, but it got me started and one step closer to getting used to the open source workflow.

Moving forward
Since that first pull request I became more confident in my ability to add some value to projects I find interesting. A few projects I’ve since contributed to:

- Warehouse - The software that powers PyPi
- PingCAP Docs
- Urbit

Albeit these contributions were rather small, the process of learning more about how open source projects are structured, how teams collaborate and how you set up a workflow in many different development environments wasn’t.

These contributions are meant to show that the individual contributions one makes don’t have to be that significant for learning to take place.
